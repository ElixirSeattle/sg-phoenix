## What to do with this repository

Create a directory in this repository with your username. Push your own work and exercises into that directory. We'll use this repo to share our work and use it for discussion.

## Rebase, Don't Merge

Please put this in your `~/.gitconfig` (or `.git/config` local to your
cloned repo if you don't want to set it globally) to avoid creating
merge commits on top of others work:

```
[branch]
  autosetuprebase = always
[pull]
  rebase = preserve
```
